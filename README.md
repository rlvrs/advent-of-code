# advent-of-code
Repository with my solutions to the Advent of Code.

Since I finished the [Martin Odersky's Scala course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1), I did not do much on Scala.
I want to change that by doing the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) in the most FP way I know as of now.

All the suggestions for improvements are highly appreciated.
